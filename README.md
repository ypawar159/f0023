# Transforming XML to JSON
The objective of this program is to read XML files from an XML folder, and
transform them to JSON. This program is partially developed.
To complete this program please fork the repository, complete the code and
send a pull request. 

Requirements are:

* **Requirement 1. Replicate folder structure:** This program should replicate the input_xml_folder structure to create a similar structure 
for the JSON files. Example of this is presented in Sample folder.
* **Requirement 2. Multiprocessing:** This program should process folders using `process_folder` separate threads up to the
MAX_THREADS identifier as in input parameter.
